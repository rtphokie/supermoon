This package calculates the upcoming Supermoon or a perigean full moon, a full Moon which occurs
near the closest point in the Moon's orbit to Earth.  The Moon appears
slightly larger as a result.

The term has no astronomical meaning. astronomers, if 
astrologer in fact.  It is a timing coincidence in the Moon's synodic month.
Supermoons are calculated on 4 popular definitions, all of which are essentially 
arbitrary.

  * Richard Nole, originated the term in 1979 an article in Dell Horoscope magazine 
    - rule 1 (1979) - A full or new Moon occurring at a distance 90% or greater than the perigee in a given orbit
    - rule 2 (2000) - A full or new Moon occurring at a distance 90% or greater than mean perigee [source](https://www.astropro.com/features/articles/supermoon/)
    - rule 3 (2011) - A full or new Moon occurring at a distance 90% or greater than the closest perigee for the calendar year.  [source](https://www.astropro.com/features/tables/cen21ce/suprmoon.html)
  * Fred Espenak - A full or new  Moon occurring at a distance 90% or greater of perigee during the current lunation. Also used by the EarthSky podcast/website [source](http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/moon/fullperigee2001.html)
  * Sky and Telescope magazine  -  A full Moon within 223,000 miles (358,884 km) of Earth [source](https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/celestial-objects-to-watch/what-is-a-supermoon)
  * TimeandDate.com  - A full Moon within 360,000 kilometres (223,694 mi) of Earth [source](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/super-full-moon.html)

Richard Nole is an astrologer who coined the term in 1979 in an article in _Dell Horoscope_magazine using a 
defnition which most closely matched Espenak's above.  In 2011, Nole clarified his definition to the one above.

While Nole, inspired by the science of the tidal aspects of a perigee [syzygy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29), 
and was presumably focused on the real increased gravitational influences in his (non-scientific) astrological predictions.  For this reason,
Nole includes both new and full Moons in his tables of supermoons.  Most mentions of supermoon in the popular media (you wont find it in
scientific media, its not an astronomy concept) focus however on full Moons near perigee for observational reasons (few people care about the Moon

Espenak's definition is also used [by EarthSky.com](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/why-experts-disagree-on-what-makes-a-supermoon#nolle)
when its closer but difficult to see during new phase.)

This package combines a couple of routines which calculate the Moon's 
[perigee and apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis), along with some calculations of when other popular labels (blue, black, blood, etc., the 
kind of thing you'd find in the Farmer's Almanac) will occur.

This collection of conflicting definitions is further described in [this article I wrote on the subject.](https://www.wral.com/weather/blogpost/11487264/).
